/**
 * In the index.ts file, you will define a TypeScript object with strict typing using a type alias. Here are the detailed steps:

Define a type alias UserProfile for an object. The object should have the following properties:

username: a string that holds the user's username. Initialize this with "john_doe".

age: a number that represents the user's age. Initialize this with 30.

isActive: a boolean indicating if the user's profile is active. Initialize this with true.

Using the UserProfile type alias, create an object named userProfile and initialize it with the values specified above for username, age, and isActive.
 */
let userProfile = {
    userName: "john_doe",
    age: 30,
    isActive: true
};
